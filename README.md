* Malwarebytes is a free security software that is designed to protect users against malware. When we say malware, it could be anything malicious that can cause damage to your device, such as Trojans, spyware, worms, and viruses.

* Because its malware database is constantly being updated, Malwarebytes can recognize almost all threats. In fact, it can block and detect about eight million threats in a day.


## How to Use Malwarebytes?

* Using Malwarebytes is easy. Just download the software and follow the onscreen prompts to install. It will take less than three minutes to complete the entire setup process. And of course, there will be no unnecessary programs, sneaky offers, and unnecessary files included in the setup. You donâ€™t even need to provide your email address.

* When you first open the application, you will be prompted to scan your device. To perform a scan, simply navigate to the Scan section and run your preferred scan.

* If potential threats are detected during the scan, they will be sent to the Quarantine section, where you can choose to restore or delete them.
